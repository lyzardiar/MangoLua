[[image]]
=== Image

An <<image, _image_>> object encapsulates information about an image or texture,
with the sole purpose to pass it across the Nuklear API and back to the application.
It may cointain either a texture id (integer) or a lightuserdata with image
information opaque to Nuklear. It may also represent a portion of an image (i.e. a 'subimage').

[[image_info]]
* _id|ptr_, _w_, _h_, <<rect, _subregion_>> = _image_++:++*info*( ) +
[small]#If _image_ is not a subimage, then only the _id_ or _ptr_ is returned.#
